The 2AM club is a popular bar in Mill Valley. It was originally named “The Brown Jug,” when it opened in 1906. It was closed in 1921 due to alcohol being illegal. It reopened in 1933, keeping its name, but was renamed to what it is now in the 1940s, when it was bought from the original owner, Bill Brown. It is the location of the cover photo of Huey Lewis And The News’ album named Sports. The band, 2AM Club is named after the bar.
